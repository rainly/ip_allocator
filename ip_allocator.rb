# All CIDR objects belong to the NetAddr module.  Where CIDR is referenced,
# the complete object path is NetAddr::CIDR.

class IPAllocator
  # supernet: a CIDR object describing a block of IPs from which allocations
  #           can be made.
  #
  # assignments: an array of CIDR objects defining which IP blocks are 
  #              already allocated and not eligible for assignment.
  #
  #              Naturally, all assignments should be a proper subset of 
  #              the supernet.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   @supernet  = NetAddr::CIDR.create('208.79.88.0/21')
  #
  #   @allocated = [NetAddr::CIDR.create('208.79.89.0/25'),
  #                 NetAddr::CIDR.create('208.79.91.0/24')]
  #
  #   @allocator = IPAllocator.new(@supernet, @allocated)
  def initialize(supernet, allocated)
    @supernet  = supernet
    @allocated = allocated
  end

  # Synopsis:
  #
  #   Find the first available block for allocation.
  #
  #   See available() for more information. 
  #
  # Arguments:
  # 
  #   Takes same arguments as available()
  #
  # Returns:
  #
  #   NetAddr::CIDR object of first available block for allocation.  nil if no
  #   block is found.
  def first_unused(size, opts = {})
    available(size, opts).first
  end

  # Synopsis:
  #
  #   Find available blocks for allocation, arranged by the order in which they
  #   should be allocated, as described in RFC 3531.
  #
  #   Available blocks are defined as blocks that are not included in 
  #   @allocated or a subnet of a member of @allocated.
  #
  #   RFC 3531 is a generalization of RFC 1219 ("On the Assignment of Subnet 
  #   Numbers").  Its first intended use is for IPv6, but can be used for any
  #   bit length addressing scheme (e.g. IPv4).
  #
  # Arguments:
  #
  #   * size of the block to find, expressed in number of bits in the netmask.
  #     For example::
  #
  #       24 = 256 IP block
  #       25 = 128 IP block
  #       ...
  #       30 = 4 IP block
  #
  #   * options to pass to CIDR#allocate_rfc3531().
  #       
  # Returns:
  #
  #   An array of NetAddr::CIDR objects of available blocks.
