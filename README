Welcome to IPAllocator
======================

:Version: v0.1

A class that helps ISP's subnet their IPv4 and IPv6 address space.

Example uses include:

  * Allocating IPs to customers
  * Allocating subnets to downstream networks
  * Allocating subnets for internal use

The latest code is available on GitHub:

  * git://github.com/up_the_irons/ip_allocator.git

Status
------

A very young class.  Current specs pass, but more are needed, especially for
edge cases and IPv6.  Correctness testing is incomplete.  Performance has not
been touched.

Makes use of NetAddr module and is not optimized for speed.

Requirements
------------

* RubyGems
* NetAddr

Installation
------------

Install NetAddr gem from RubyForge::

  gem install -r netaddr

Put this code somewhere and require it in your code::

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ip_allocator'

Example
-------

::

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ip_allocator'

  @supernet  = NetAddr::CIDR.create('208.79.88.0/21')
  
  @allocated = [NetAddr::CIDR.create('208.79.89.0/25'),
                NetAddr::CIDR.create('208.79.91.0/24')]
  
  @allocator = IPAllocator.new(@supernet, @allocated)

  # Give me a /24
  @allocator.first_unused(24).to_s                      => '208.79.88.0/24'

TODO
----

* Specs

  - Correctness
  - IPv6

* Some performance testing

Formatting
----------

This README is formatted in reStructredText [RST]_.  It has the best
correlation between what a document looks like as plain text vs. its
formatted output (HTML, LaTeX, etc...).  What I like best is, markup doesn't
look like markup, even though it is.

RDoc sucks.
